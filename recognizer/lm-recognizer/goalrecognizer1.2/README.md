# Planning-Landmarks

A Java implementation for generating landmarks from planning problems.

We implemented two methods to extract landmarks:

* Extract conjuctive landmarks (PartialLandmarkGenerator)

    From: Hoffmann et al: Ordered Landmarks in Planning. (http://aaaipress.org/Papers/JAIR/Vol22/JAIR-2208.pdf)
    
* Extract resource abstracted landmarks (ResourceAbstractedLandmarkExtraction)

    From: Porteous et al: Extending Landmark Analysis to reason about Resources and Repetition. (http://www.cis.strath.ac.uk/research/publications/papers/strath_cis_publication_81.pdf)
